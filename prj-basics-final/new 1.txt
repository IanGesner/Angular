Dear Grandma & Mike,

Thank you very much for your extraordinary generosity when allowing me to stay with you.

It was nice to develop a closer relationship to both of you.

I miss you both almost as much as your cooking and baking.

Providing me with such a great environment allowed me to finish school relatively stresslessly 
when I wasn't able to do it under other conditions,
and it will change my life forever.
 
In your debt
I am in your debt and I
